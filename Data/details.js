This design empowers users to create more specific rules tailored to their needs. \r\n\r\nThe clause selection engine features a picklist containing all eligible clauses, which are evaluated upon record load according to our predefined rules. \r\n\r\nAlso implemented some other features like approvals, email alerts, flows etc.",
